# React Native FlatList: Empty List Despite Data

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the React Native `FlatList` component where the list remains empty even though data is available.  This often occurs because of asynchronous data loading or improper data handling. 

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` presents the corrected version. This example uses mock data for simplicity; however, the core issue applies to data fetching from external sources (e.g., APIs).

**How to reproduce the bug:**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`. 
4. Observe that the FlatList initially renders empty, and even if the data updates successfully, it doesn't reflect immediately. 

**Solution:** The corrected `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates several methods to handle asynchronous updates correctly.
